### Hi there 👋

My name is Eduardo Ellery,

I work as a Tech Lead / Software Architect / Software Engineer.
I've been an Engineering Manager before and it's something I also enjoy. 😊

I'm a podcast addict, coffee lover and sports passionate.
I used to read a lot of comic books, but I don't do it so often anymore.

I have a daughter 👧 and I just try to be the best dad I can be. She is the most important thing in my life. 🥰

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some personal projects 🤫 
- 🌞 My day job is at Hilti, and my night job is at B.P.R.D. (hehe) 🌝
- 📫 How to reach me: usually by `@eduellery` (but I'll add some badges below anyway)
- 😊 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I already run 2 marathons. For the last one, I trained my wife and we did it together 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
