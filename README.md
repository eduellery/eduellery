### Hello there 👋

My name is Eduardo Ellery, and I'm a skilled Tech Lead, Software Architect, and Software Engineer with experience as an Engineering Manager. I have a passion for leading technical teams and delivering high-quality software solutions. 😊

When I'm not working, you can find me indulging in my hobbies like listening to podcasts, enjoying a good cup of coffee, and watching sports. I used to be an avid comic book reader, but nowadays I spend most of my free time with my daughter 👧, who is the most important person in my life. 🥰

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some exciting personal projects 🤫 
- ☀️ You can find me working at Hilti during the day and doing some side hustle at B.P.R.D. during the night 🌙
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me through my social media handle `@eduellery` or using the contact badges below
- 😊 My pronouns are He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I already run 2 marathons. For the last one, I trained my wife and we did it together 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
