### Hello there 👋

My name is Eduardo Ellery and I'm a Principal Engineer passionate about leading technical teams and delivering high-quality software solutions. 😊

When I'm not working, I indulge in hobbies like listening to podcasts, enjoying a good cup of coffee, and watching sports.
I used to be an avid comic book reader, but nowadays I spend most of my free time with my daughter 👧, who is the most important person in my life. 🥰

- 🔭 I’m always working on some personal projects 🤫
- 🌱 I’m investing my time in Rust and Zig
- ☀️ You can find me working at Hilti during the day, and doing some side hustle for BPRD at night 🌙
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on my social media handle `@eduellery` or using the contact badges below
- 😊 My pronouns are He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have already run 3 marathons. In 2019, I trained with my wife and we both ran together 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
